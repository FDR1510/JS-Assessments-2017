// 1. Write an anonymous function that takes one argument of type number and decides if that number is evenly divisble by three or not. If it is, print the number and "is divisible by three". If it is not, print that the number "is not divisble by three".

// 2. Write about yourself using an object. Include at least three properties of you and store your object in a variable with your name.

// 3. Create an array with at least 4 items inside it. Then, access one of the values and console log it. 

// 4. Have the function AlphabetSoup(str) take an str string parameter and return a string with the letters in alphabetical order (ie. hello becomes ehllo). Assume numbers and punctuation symbols will not be included in the string. This will require some googling.

// Input:"hooplah"
// Output:"ahhloop"

function AlphabetSoup(str) {

    // code goes here  
	
	return str; 
}

// keep this function call here 
AlphabetSoup(readline());   

// 5. Given the arrays below, use a for loop to print one value from each array concatenated together. How would your code need to change to accomodate arrays of different lengths?

var nums = [1, 5, 88, 2, 5, 42, 57, 101]

var nouns = ["duck", "telephone booths", "the enterprise", "robots", "amazon", "eraser", "zafod", "a"]

// output of the first time through the loop should be: "1 ducks"

// 6. Create an object "coffeeMachine" with attributes coffee and water. These attributes should have boolean values - false meaning there is not enough, and true meaning there is enough. Next, create a method for our coffeeMachine object to run the machine. The result of this method should be a message, saying that coffee is ready. There must be enough water and coffee in order to run the machine. If there aren't enough of either, the coffe maker should send you a message saying "add more ____."

var coffeeMachine = {

// your code here

}
